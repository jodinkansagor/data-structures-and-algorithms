# Reverse an Array
Take any array and reverse it.

## Challenge
Reverse an array

## Approach and Efficiency
Thought that map made sense because we had an array and wanted another array of the same size. 

## Solution
Take an array. Check out how long it is. Reset the index of each value of the array based on 1 minus the length minus the current index.
